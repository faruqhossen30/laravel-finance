        <p class="mb-4">
            At <span class="font-semibold">Bankingscoop.com</span>, we respect your privacy and are committed to giving you
            control over your personal information. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and similar laws,
            California residents have the right to opt out of the "sale" or "sharing" of their personal information. This
            page explains your rights and how you can exercise them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">What Does “Sell” or “Share” Mean?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Under the CCPA, "sell" refers to transferring personal information to a third party for monetary or other
            valuable consideration. Similarly, "share" refers to making personal information available to third parties for
            targeted advertising or similar purposes.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            <span class="font-semibold">Bankingscoop.com</span> does not sell your personal information in exchange for
            monetary compensation. However, we may share certain information with third parties, such as analytics or
            advertising partners, to improve our services and provide personalized experiences.
        </p>
